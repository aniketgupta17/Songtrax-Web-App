# Songtrax-Web-App
Overview

In the React Web App assessment (the 1st part of the Cross-Platform Project), you’ll build an interactive web app with a cross-platform JavaScript framework (React), testing across web browsers & device sizes. The web app will communicate with web & device APIs that are shared across the Cross-Platform Project. Throughout, you’ll evaluate the design, implementation & architecture for delivering a complex web app. Work towards this assessment will then inform the 2nd part of the Cross-Platform Project — the React Native App assessment.
Learning Objectives

After successfully completing this assessment, you should be able to in part:
1. Apply an intermediate knowledge of functional programming with vanilla JavaScript.
2. Build interactive web apps with a cross-platform JavaScript framework, testing across web browsers & device sizes.
4. Communicate with web & device APIs that are shared across web/native apps.
5. Apply consideration of user interface (UI) principles & user data privacy for web/native apps.
6. Evaluate the design, implementation & architecture for delivering complex, cross-platform web/native apps.
7. Develop customised testing regimes for evaluating design, code & security of cross-platform web/native apps.
What Am I Building?

For this assessment, you’ll be building the web app portion of the Cross-Platform Project using React Web & dependencies.
Your task is to build both a web app & a mobile app for a music & location based experience similar to Pokémon GO. The app is called SongTrax. In the web app, users will create music samples to be shared to a location (saved to an API). In the mobile app (built in A3 - React Native App), users can experience these music samples by physically visiting each location (read from the API).
With this app, you’re asked to demonstrate all of what you’ve learned & practiced in Lectures & Contacts until Week 8. This includes, but is not limited to:
Vanilla JavaScript topics between Weeks 1 and 4 for techniques in functional & asynchronous programming.
Creating a React Web project using “create-react-app” and building a distributable bundle for deployment.
Building React Web components in a nested & modular fashion (across multiple files), enabling routing (via React Router) for multiple, linked pages.
Using JSX to combine HTML elements, React Web components & JavaScript logic together in an appropriate manner.
Using states & hooks in React Web to read & transform data, including reading & saving to the provided web API.
Using the Tone.js framework (and by extension, the Web Audio API behind the scenes) to generate layered sounds.
Additionally, we expect that you’ll continue to apply good practice web design techniques from DECO1400 where appropriate, such as the use of a more semantic HTML structure (e.g. element choices, naming of classes etc).
